With a less than ideal start to our first official semester, we needed to figure out new ways to engage the campus community and establish ourselves as a legitimate production house. We're glad to announce Studio Centauri, a moniker that we've donned to take advantage of the only thing that works right now, an internet presence. We feel this is an important step to lay down the foundations of what's coming in this tenure and in the future. We want to prove that the gaming industry in our country is a vibrant one, and to emphasize the sheer amounts of creativity and technical proficiency that go into making an enjoyable game. We plan to do that by engaging with our community in new ways and, more importantly, providing each and everyone tools to create a game on their own.

## Summer Camp

The Science and Technology Council's summer camp was a significant step in this direction, and we're thrilled to present the work of the two participating teams. These teams had to overcome both artistic and technical challenges during the production of their game. We made sure that they got the complete experience of working together on a game.

**Skyfall** is a mobile, endless runner style game that follows an astronaut as their space mission goes wrong. Dodge the space debris and use powerful pickups to increase your score, but also keep an eye on your oxygen gauge!

**Infected** is a platformer shooter. Research into a bioweapon has thrown the world into chaos and unleashed a disease with no cure. You're trapped inside the very same lab where it all started. Annihilate the virus as a hero and save the world!

You can check out both of these games on our [itch page](https://studiocentauri.itch.io/).

## Community

We strive to keep our projects as accessible as possible. All collaboration on projects happens on our Discord, and all code will be freely available to tinker around with. Unfortunately, GitHub is not well-suited to the nature of our work because of their data limits, so we're in the process of establishing a robust solution for collaboration and version control. We encourage everyone to participate in our projects through that medium. You're free to hit us up anytime and contribute to our projects.

We understand the general impression that one needs to be a secretary to be a part of a society. That is not the case at all. We're committed to keeping our functioning as open as possible to give everyone an equal opportunity to learn and grow. But note that while all projects will be accessible to everyone on our version control, they will be announced through our public channels only when they're ready.

We plan to fulfil our ambitions through a mix of short-term and long-term plans, to learn and practice our skills and to deliver finished products to the campus. Taking baby steps is the way to go, till the time we can learn to sprint towards creating games that have a significant impact on our audience. We want to ensure that the group does not die out in a couple of years.
